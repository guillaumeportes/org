* Facts
** Runway until begining of February '24
** Burn is €55K
** Mana Storm
*** US CPI > $2.5
*** Low volume
*** 2 months away from testable state (onboarding / monetisation / pvp metagame all missing)
** No other real revenue (F2F is $1K / month, BattleHand was shut down, etc.)
* Options
** Pursuing Mana Storm does not feel like a viable option
*** Too expensive to test
*** CPI will likely rise significantly
** Work for Hire
*** Ad agency work taking ages to materialise
*** Margin is unknown
** Roblox / Supersolid
*** Yet another "pivot"
*** Far from a done deal
** Voodoo retainer
*** $15K / month
*** Extends the runway by 2 months
*** 5 months to find success
** Other potential HC publishers
*** Very unlikely to get close to the £30K / month we got from Coda
** Apple Arcade
*** No obvious appetite as no answer to feeler
** Finding a publisher for Mana Storm
*** Timeline feels too challenging
* Thoughts
** None of the options allow us to pursue Mana Storm
** All options feel like survival as opposed to opportunities
** We have been surviving for a long time
** It is very unlikely that something special comes out of surviving
** Surviving does not allow for reflection

*** The following are times we were working on stuff we rushed into, had to scramble, etc. Total time: ~9 years
**** Dragon Finga: 8/12 - 4/14
**** Kongregate: 9/15 - 6/18
